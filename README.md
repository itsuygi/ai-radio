# ai-radio
An AI-powered radio DJ has been developed to select and play music that harmonizes and blends well with the previous tracks played. This AI DJ is capable of analyzing the beat, genre, and other attributes of the songs to ensure a seamless listening experience.

The program uses OpenAI's API to fetch the best new track of the current playlist. After logging in to the Spotify web player using automated web browser, it searches for the selected song and plays it.

Once the current song finishes playing, the system fetches a new song from the AI and repeats the process to ensure a continuous flow of harmonious music.

Setup:
1. Set your OpenAI api key.
2. Set your spotify username and password (it just stays in the code, never published. required to login to spotify web browser.)
3. Set the first song's name and artist and enjoy the continuous flow of harmonious music.
